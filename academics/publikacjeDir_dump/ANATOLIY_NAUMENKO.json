Novelty of the article is in the described process of impact of the book on criminals in the territory of Western Siberia considered through the cultural, historical and psychological aspects. With the use of previously unknown archival materials there are revealed the cure methods of the condemned by using the book, and the relationship to the prison literature of the political prisoners. The personality of prisoners differed by a set of moral qualities, but almost all of them were ready to the perception of people around and themselves through the literature. Illiteracy was the main obstacle in education of the condemned, but the administration of prisons opened prison schools and organized reading literature aloud. The first prison libraries appeared in the 1860-ies and were replenished generally at the expense of philanthropists. F.M. Dostoyevsky\u2019s novels \u201cCrime and Punishment\u201d and \u201cNotes from the Dead House\u201d, fairy tales and poems by A.S. Pushkin were the most popular books: they filled life with romanticism and were a compensation factor. Political prisoners denied any educational methods, preferring to read revolutionary literature. It is impossible to track extent of impact of book on the process of correction of criminals, but it is possible to claim that libraries started forming the atmosphere of book which is the most important condition of education in prisons, and is a necessary prerequisite for correction of a convicted person.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.25281/0869-608x-2016-1-2-171-176", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2017, 12, 12]], "date-time": "2017-12-12T18:38:54Z", "timestamp": 1513103934000}, "page": "171-176", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Book as a Cure of the Condemned: From the History of Penitentiary System of Western Siberia (second half of the 19th - beginning of the 20th century)"], "prefix": "10.25281", "volume": "1", "author": [{"given": "Olga N.", "family": "Naumenko", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Evgeny A.", "family": "Naumenko", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "10921", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2016, 4, 28]]}, "reference": [{"key": "ref1", "unstructured": "Koryakin M.V.
