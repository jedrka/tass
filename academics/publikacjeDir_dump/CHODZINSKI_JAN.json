Teaching and Learning is a nonprofit professional publication started in 2002 by myself, then Associate Dean of the Faculty of Education and the Brock-Golden Horseshoe Education Consortium which consists of ten school boards and the faculty of education, Brock University located in the greater Niagara Region of Ontario Canada. The publication is designed primarily to enhance the professional development of teachers and others interested in education in schools and communities. The topics for each issue are determined by an executive board and are decided at an annual meeting. Each board and the faculty contribute financially to the publication. And receive 600-700 copies of each issue three times a year. Subscribers contribute to the funding as do occasional selected advertisers and sales of single and multiple copies. The publication is perhaps more of a professional periodical and newsletter than a \"formal\" scholarly journal (meaning \"blind\" reviews, although that said most articles other than interviews and solicited lead articles are vetted by selected readers). The publication combines elements of both a professional publication and a journal and attracts authors and readers from all segments including applied research. Our readership is local, national and international. Articles are received in a variety of ways. They are usually in response to a formal call for papers printed in previous issues. In addition the editor solicits articles from key professionals and from time to time interviews selected individuals who have contributed significantly to the focus of the issue. Articles are received by the editor and read for content, relevance, appropriate writing style and clarity of thought and articulate communication of what is important in terms of the professional development interests highlighted in the issue at hand. Articles are then sent to selected readers (who have volunteered to adjudicate but who wish to remain anonymous) for readability and to determine if the article would be appropriate for inclusion in Teaching and Learning. I f the article is deemed acceptable then authors are advised and the editor works with the authors and the publisher to edit the article to fit the space, style and format of the publication (81/2x11, 3 column format 32-36 pages).

In my capacity as the first Associate Dean of the Faculty of Education at Brock University, Ontario, Canada, I envisioned and proposed the development of a professional development newsletter/ journal/magazine that would become one of the voices of the Brock-Golden Horseshoe Educational Consortium. This advisory group is a unique coming together of eleven area school boards and a Faculty of Education with a defined purpose to further understanding and increase communication between education partners in the region known to many as the Greater Niagara Golden Horseshoe. It was my intention then that the interviews, articles, reviews and resources and local school board content published in each issue reflect a thematic, purpose with featured, invited, adjudicated, re-edited or reprinted professional development articles. More important it would be reader friendly, professionally informative and a publication that readers would want to collect, refer to and pass on. I believe that over the years the journal has evolved and delivered on its promise and has established a forum for new writers and previously published experts across a broad range of themes featured in the 11 issues published since Spring 2002. Our first printing, Internship and Mentorship was between 300 and 500 copies. Since then we graduated to a high of almost twelve thousand printed copies of the issue on Bullying (sold out twice) and have regularly printed and distributed between 7000 - 8500, (32-36 pages ) copies of each issue such as Storytelling, Boys and Literacy, Stress in Schools, Leadership, Assessment and other titles. Authors and readers including a small but dedicated group of subscribers comprise not only a local following but a national and international base of contributors, readers and believers. This, my final issue as editor, brings together an interesting blend of articles that deal with action research as a viable and robust research method for dealing with issues that arise in education and social care settings.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.26522/tl.v4i2.18", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2017, 7, 28]], "date-time": "2017-07-28T00:19:17Z", "timestamp": 1501201157000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["From the Editor:Teaching and Learning is Five Years Old.

Stress is defined by Hans Selye as \"essentially the wear and tear caused b y life.\" Based on that assumption, it would seem that stress is almost unavoidable; yet it seems we do much in our lives to bring about that which we try desperately to avoid.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.26522/tl.v3i3.31", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2017, 7, 28]], "date-time": "2017-07-28T00:19:17Z", "timestamp": 1501201157000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["From the Editor"], "prefix": "10.26522", "volume": "3", "author": [{"given": "Raymond", "family": "Chodzinski", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "11060", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2006, 9, 1]]}, "container-title": ["Teaching and Learning"], "link": [{"URL": "https://brock.scholarsportal.info/journals/teachingandlearning/home/article/viewFile/31/50", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://brock.scholarsportal.info/journals/teachingandlearning/home/article/viewFile/31/50", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2017, 7, 28]], "date-time": "2017-07-28T00:19:30Z", "timestamp": 1501201170000}, "score": 21.130539, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2006, 9, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2006, 9, 30]]}, "issue": "3"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.26522/tl.v3i3.31", "ISSN": ["1703-2598"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1703-2598", "type": "print"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2018, 5, 7]], "date-time": "2018-05-07T19:25:07Z", "timestamp": 1525721107267}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Brock University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["teachlearn"], "abstract": "<jats:p>This issue called for papers and articles related to leadership innovations in schools. As I look back on my career, I recall many opportunities to provide leadership not only in schools but also in communities. In each case, there was always an expressed need either presented by existing conditions or through analysis of practices that were not working. Always it was about change and how to improve on what was already happening or not happening in my school environment. I recall that the key driving force behind every venture was what I could do to improve the learning experiences of the students I taught. With each project I learned that vision and creativity were necessary but if the project was to succeed collaboration and cooperation was essential. Over the years I have taken and taught various courses on leadership and the implementation of innovative change strategies. That said, in its simplest terms providing innovative leadership in schools comes down to controlling a variety of factors, far too many to write about in this column. However, I created a little equation for myself (6P's) that has guided every project. Be prepared. With careful Planning (vision and action strategies) a project unfolds as it emerges from infancy to implementation. Cultivate a Principal. Invest energy in an administrator who believes and supports the project (power and funding are important aspects of any project and they can help in this regard.). It is important to understand and accept that effective administrators have the authority and the power to influence decisions. Always collaborate and involve Parents. They are often your key to success and usually your best allies. Involve them in as many ways as possible. Ensure that other Partners (colleagues, students, consultants, media, etc.) are informed, involved and kept in the loop. Keep a high Profile (you need to get your project noticed and accepted). And finally, maintain a Principled approach (ethics, values and adherence to professional practice).</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.26522/tl.v3i2.39", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2017, 7, 28]], "date-time": "2017-07-28T00:19:17Z", "timestamp": 1501201157000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["From the Editor"], "prefix": "10.26522", "volume": "3", "author": [{"given": "Raymond", "family": "Chodzinski", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "11060", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2006, 4, 1]]}, "container-title": ["Teaching and Learning"], "link": [{"URL": "https://brock.scholarsportal.info/journals/teachingandlearning/home/article/viewFile/39/58", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://brock.scholarsportal.info/journals/teachingandlearning/home/article/viewFile/39/58", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2017, 7, 28]], "date-time": "2017-07-28T00:19:34Z", "timestamp": 1501201174000}, "score": 21.130539, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2006, 4, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2006, 6, 30]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.26522/tl.v3i2.39", "ISSN": ["1703-2598"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1703-2598", "type": "print"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2018, 5, 7]], "date-time": "2018-05-07T19:25:07Z", "timestamp": 1525721107278}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Brock University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["teachlearn"], "abstract": "<jats:p>The Ontario College of Teachers Foundations of Professional Practice (2004) pg .16 describes a teaching responsibility as promoting \"Leadership and Community\u201d.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.26522/tl.v3i2.40", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2017, 7, 28]], "date-time": "2017-07-28T00:19:17Z", "timestamp": 1501201157000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["The Ontario College Teachers Foundation of Professional Practice"], "prefix": "10.26522", "volume": "3", "author": [{"given": "Raymond", "family": "Chodzinski", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "11060", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2006, 4, 1]]}, "container-title": ["Teaching and Learning"], "link": [{"URL": "https://brock.scholarsportal.info/journals/teachingandlearning/home/article/viewFile/40/59", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://brock.scholarsportal.info/journals/teachingandlearning/home/article/viewFile/40/59", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2017, 7, 28]], "date-time": "2017-07-28T00:19:35Z", "timestamp": 1501201175000}, "score": 21.130539, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2006, 4, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2006, 6, 30]]}, "issue": "2"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.26522/tl.v3i2.40", "ISSN": ["1703-2598"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1703-2598", "type": "print"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2018, 5, 7]], "date-time": "2018-05-07T19:25:09Z", "timestamp": 1525721109721}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Brock University Library", "issue": "2", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["teachlearn"], "abstract": "<jats:p>Recently I had the opportunity to interview Dr. Veronica Lacey about several issues related to testing and evaluation concerns.

The book sponsored by the Toronto Public Library system is the first in a series of publications that seeks to give voice to the stories, thoughts and poems of teens living in the city of Toronto. Josephine Bryant, City Librarian, Toronto public Library writes, \"here are the powerful stories of youth who agreed to share their experiences and their stories. It is an attempt to bring a positive approach to the issue of street youth. \" Fran Fearnley says Adam, Allan, Caitlin, Claire, Debbie, Don, Janice, Kevin and Sue told us about their encounters with violence in one on one-taped interviews. Their very own words transcribed from those interviews, are what you will read. They are authentic oral testimonies as told to an empathetic listener. Dr. Fred Mathews a social worker with Central Toronto Youth Services concludes the book with advice to children and teens about what to do if they or others are or know of someone in need. He reminds young people \"they must learn to trust teachers and educators and tell a teacher, principal, school worker, or other adult . I f they do not listen, tell a police officer, a nurse, parents, a friend but tell someone. Don't let previous negative experiences with some adults in power affect your decision, keep trying until you find someone who will believe you and take action. The important thing is do not stand by and let others be harmed. Violence is fueled by silence and stops when we all take a stand.\" (page 143)</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.26522/tl.v3i1.53", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2017, 7, 28]], "date-time": "2017-07-28T00:19:17Z", "timestamp": 1501201157000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["A conversation with former editor-in-chief of Parets Magazine ans editor of On Four Walls"], "prefix": "10.26522", "volume": "3", "author": [{"given": "Fran", "family": "Fearnley", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Raymond", "family": "Chodzinski", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "11060", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2005, 12, 1]]}, "container-title": ["Teaching and Learning"], "link": [{"URL": "https://brock.scholarsportal.info/journals/teachingandlearning/home/article/viewFile/53/76", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://brock.scholarsportal.info/journals/teachingandlearning/home/article/viewFile/53/76", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2017, 8, 9]], "date-time": "2017-08-09T14:49:13Z", "timestamp": 1502290153000}, "score": 19.283043, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2005, 12, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2005, 1, 30]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.26522/tl.v3i1.53", "ISSN": ["1703-2598"], "issn-type": [{"value": "1703-2598", "type": "print"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2018, 5, 7]], "date-time": "2018-05-07T19:25:09Z", "timestamp": 1525721109721}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Brock University Library", "issue": "1", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["teachlearn"], "abstract": "<jats:p>This issue of Teaching and Learning is devoted to induction practices as they relate to beginning teachers and other leadership roles.
