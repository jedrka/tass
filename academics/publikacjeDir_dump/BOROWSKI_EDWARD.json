Independently of the side leaf, the application of the fertilizer at a higher light intensity had a significantly better consecutive effect on all the analysed properties of the leaves.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.2478/fhort-2013-0126", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 8, 1]], "date-time": "2013-08-01T20:11:10Z", "timestamp": 1375387870000}, "page": "61-71", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["The effect of placement and light conditions during foliar application of Insol U fertilizer on gas exchange, yield and the quality of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.)"], "prefix": "10.2478", "volume": "21", "author": [{"given": "Edward", "family": "Borowski", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "S\u0142awomir", "family": "Micha\u0142ek", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "374", "container-title": ["Folia Horticulturae"], "link": [{"URL": "http://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/fhort/21/1/article-p61.xml", "content-type": "text/html", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/fhort.2009.21.issue-1/fhort-2013-0126/fhort-2013-0126.pdf", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 7, 14]], "date-time": "2018-07-14T16:22:19Z", "timestamp": 1531585339000}, "score": 20.12929, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2009, 6, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/fhort-2013-0126", "ISSN": ["2083-5965", "0867-1761"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0867-1761", "type": "print"}, {"value": "2083-5965", "type": "electronic"}], "subject": ["Horticulture"]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2018, 5, 2]], "date-time": "2018-05-02T22:19:31Z", "timestamp": 1525299571579}, "reference-count": 19, "publisher": "Elsevier BV", "issue": "1", "license": [{"URL": "http://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/", "start": {"date-parts": [[1995, 3, 1]], "date-time": "1995-03-01T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 794016000000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "tdm"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Biophysical Chemistry"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[1995, 3]]}, "DOI": "10.1016/0301-4622(94)00114-y", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2002, 7, 25]], "date-time": "2002-07-25T15:52:45Z", "timestamp": 1027612365000}, "page": "49-60", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 10, "title": ["Molecular dynamics of amphotericin B I.

"<jats:p>In a pot experiment conducted in a phytotron, the effectiveness of foliar nutrition of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) with different magnesium salts with and without the addition of 0.5% CO(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was studied. Magnesium was applied 3 times in the form of solutions of MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; x 7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, Mg(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; x 6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; x 6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Mg x 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, compared to water as the control treatment. The obtained results showed that foliar feeding of spinach with inorganic magnesium salts was an efficient method for supplementing the Mg level in plants during the growing period. But the application of a metalo-organic complex in the form of magnesium acetate (C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Mg x 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) at a concentration of 1.7%, in spite of a similar effect on leaf Mg content, induced phytotoxic symptoms in the form of chlorotic and necrotic spots on the leaves. The application of the solutions of inorganic magnesium salts had a significant effect, resulting in more intensive leaf gas exchange (stomatal conductance, transpiration and photosynthesis) and an increase in leaf yield. Magnesium sulphate affected the abovementioned processes in the most effective way, while magnesium acetate had a negative impact. Foliar feeding of spinach with the magnesium salts resulted in an increased leaf content of protein, chlorophyll, carotenoids, nitrates and proline, but a decrease in vitamin C content. The addition of urea to the applied magnesium salt solutions increased the plant gas exchange rates and the leaf content of protein, chlorophyll, carotenoids, nitrates and proline, but it decreased the content of vitamin C, potassium and magnesium.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.5586/aa.2010.009", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 4, 10]], "date-time": "2013-04-10T20:46:50Z", "timestamp": 1365626810000}, "page": "77-86", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 1, "title": ["The effect of foliar nutrition of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) with magnesium salts and urea on gas exchange, leaf yield and quality"], "prefix": "10.5586", "volume": "63", "author": [{"given": "Edward", "family": "Borowski", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "S\u0142awomir", "family": "Micha\u0142ek", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "3614", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2012]]}, "container-title": ["Acta Agrobotanica"], "link": [{"URL": "https://pbsociety.org.pl/journals/index.php/aa/article/viewFile/1503/1185", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://pbsociety.org.pl/journals/index.php/aa/article/viewFile/1503/1185", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2017, 2, 3]], "date-time": "2017-02-03T11:32:37Z", "timestamp": 1486121557000}, "score": 20.12929, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2012]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2012]]}, "issue": "1"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.5586/aa.2010.009", "ISSN": ["2300-357X"], "issn-type": [{"value": "2300-357X", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2018, 5, 2]], "date-time": "2018-05-02T20:02:13Z", "timestamp": 1525291333523}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Elsevier BV", "license": [{"URL": "http://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/", "start": {"date-parts": [[1966, 1, 1]], "date-time": "1966-01-01T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": -126230400000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "tdm"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Journal of Chromatography A"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[1966, 1]]}, "DOI": "10.1016/s0021-9673(01)98716-3", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2002, 7, 25]], "date-time": "2002-07-25T08:25:58Z", "timestamp": 1027585558000}, "page": "480-482", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 65, "title": ["A new spray reagent replacing sulphuric acid in thin-layer chromatography"], "prefix": "10.1016", "volume": "23", "author": [{"given": "Tadeusz", "family": "Zimi\u0144ski", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "Edward", "family": "Borowski", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "78", "container-title": ["Journal of Chromatography A"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0021967301987163?httpAccept=text/xml", "content-type": "text/xml", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "http://api.elsevier.com/content/article/PII:S0021967301987163?httpAccept=text/plain", "content-type": "text/plain", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2015, 2, 14]], "date-time": "2015-02-14T05:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1423890000000}, "score": 20.12929, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1966, 1]]}, "references-count": 0, "alternative-id": ["S0021967301987163"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0021-9673(01)98716-3", "ISSN": ["0021-9673"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0021-9673", "type": "print"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2018, 5, 2]], "date-time": "2018-05-02T23:54:15Z", "timestamp": 1525305255364}, "reference-count": 23, "publisher": "Elsevier BV", "issue": "2-3", "license": [{"URL": "http://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/", "start": {"date-parts": [[1996, 1, 1]], "date-time": "1996-01-01T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 820454400000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "tdm"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Biophysical Chemistry"], "published-print": {"date-parts": [[1996, 1]]}, "DOI": "10.1016/0301-4622(95)00062-7", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2002, 7, 25]], "date-time": "2002-07-25T21:19:25Z", "timestamp": 1027631965000}, "page": "205-217", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 30, "title": ["Molecular dynamics of amphotericin B.

Peat or pine bark addition to rape or triticale straw substrates had no significant effect on the change in their commercially useful traits. In the opinion of the present authors, substrates made of rape or triticale straw alone, and even more so with the addition of peat or bark, are not inferior in any way to commonly used rockwool.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.5586/aa.2012.006", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2013, 1, 4]], "date-time": "2013-01-04T10:33:55Z", "timestamp": 1357295635000}, "page": "49-56", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Effect of different growing substrates on the plant water relations and marketable fruit yield greenhouse-grown tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.)"], "prefix": "10.5586", "volume": "65", "author": [{"given": "Edward", "family": "Borowski", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "J\u00f3zef", "family": "Nurzy\u0144ski", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "3614", "published-online": {"date-parts": [[2012]]}, "container-title": ["Acta Agrobotanica"], "link": [{"URL": "https://pbsociety.org.pl/journals/index.php/aa/article/viewFile/1061/820", "content-type": "application/pdf", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "text-mining"}, {"URL": "https://pbsociety.org.pl/journals/index.php/aa/article/viewFile/1061/820", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2017, 2, 3]], "date-time": "2017-02-03T11:31:31Z", "timestamp": 1486121491000}, "score": 20.12929, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2012]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-online": {"date-parts": [[2012]]}, "issue": "3"}, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.5586/aa.2012.006", "ISSN": ["2300-357X"], "issn-type": [{"value": "2300-357X", "type": "electronic"}]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2018, 5, 7]], "date-time": "2018-05-07T17:10:32Z", "timestamp": 1525713032021}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Polish Botanical Society", "issue": "1", "license": [{"URL": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0", "start": {"date-parts": [[2012, 1, 1]], "date-time": "2012-01-01T00:00:00Z", "timestamp": 1325376000000}, "delay-in-days": 0, "content-version": "unspecified"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Acta Agrobot"], "abstract": "<jats:p>In a pot experiment conducted in a phytotron, the effectiveness of foliar feeding of different potassium salts, with and without the addition of 0.5% CO(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, in spinach (&lt;i&gt;Spinacia oleracea&lt;/i&gt; L.) was investigated.
