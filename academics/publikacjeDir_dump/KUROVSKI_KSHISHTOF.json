The good news is that of the total MSW 5.6 million tons was recycled in 1960 and by 2012 the amount surged to 86.6 million tons. This real-world case (to protect privacy, names have been changed) chronicles the development of a strategic supply chain decision within a heavily regulated industry that is characterized by hybrid public/private organizations. It illustrates the importance of contract compliance and quality control assessment. In addition, it is heavily imbedded within the sustainability conversation. Finally, integral elements of the case are ethics and organizational trust, which, regardless of contract obligations, is essential in reciprocal relationships and community/customer support.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.19030/jsm.v2i2.8980", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 2, 2]], "date-time": "2016-02-02T17:08:29Z", "timestamp": 1454432909000}, "page": "43", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Talking Trash: Ethics, Sustainability, And Organizational Trust"], "prefix": "10.19030", "volume": "2", "author": [{"given": "C.

As the case unfolds, Greene has an Eureka experience and learns from a colleague how interns can and do make vital contributions (ROI\u2019s) to their assigned organizations. Upon reviewing the contributions that interns made in three organizations, she redesigns Braxston\u2019s Internship program, reviews the State University Intern to Work Program that addresses, among many other factors, the internship purpose, supervision, learning objectives,\u00a0 and intern and employer obligations.\u00a0 The case includes an Intern Evaluation form and a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the university and the company. Last, the Questions and Instructions provide for focused discussion and analysis and the references enable learners to research the top internship programs in the United States.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.19030/jbcs.v12i2.9621", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2016, 4, 1]], "date-time": "2016-04-01T02:55:05Z", "timestamp": 1459479305000}, "page": "41", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Internships: The Nuts And Bolts Of An Effective Program"], "prefix": "10.19030", "volume": "12", "author": [{"given": "C.
