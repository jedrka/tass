Songs from Broadway shows were immensely popular with commercial singers at the time, such as Perry Como, Dinah Shore, Peggy Lee, and Rosemary Clooney; their renditions often shot to the top of the pop charts for weeks on end. Often these songs were placed by music publishers with A&amp;R (artists and repertory) divisions in advance of their appearance in the actual Broadway show, as a way to promote both song and show. The LP format had matured by the mid-1950s and artists such as Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald dug deep into the catalog of Broadway songs from the earlier decades of the century to fill out extended \u201csongbook\u201d tributes to great Broadway songwriters, often restoring obscure material to the popular consciousness.</p>", "DOI": "10.1093/oso/9780199832538.003.0007", "type": "book", "created": {"date-parts": [[2018, 9, 20]], "date-time": "2018-09-20T17:57:11Z", "timestamp": 1537466231000}, "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Songs for Swingin\u2019 Show Fans"], "prefix": "10.1093", "author": [{"given": "Laurence", "family": "Maslon", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "286", "container-title": ["Oxford Scholarship Online"], "original-title": ["Songs for Swingin\u2019 Show Fans"], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 9, 20]], "date-time": "2018-09-20T17:57:11Z", "timestamp": 1537466231000}, "score": 20.65818, "issued": {"date-parts": [[2018, 9, 20]]}, "references-count": 0, "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780199832538.003.0007"}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2018, 9, 20]], "date-time": "2018-09-20T18:11:33Z", "timestamp": 1537467093028}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "Oxford University Press", "isbn-type": [{"value": "9780199832538", "type": "print"}], "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "published-print": {"date-parts": [[2018, 9, 20]]}, "abstract": "<p>The crossroads where the music of Broadway met popular culture was an expansive and pervasive juncture throughout most of the twentieth century and continues to influence the cultural discourse of today. <italic>Broadway to Main Street: How Show Music Enchanted America</italic> details how Americans heard the music from Broadway on every Main Street across the country over the last 125 years, from sheet music, radio, and recordings to television and the Internet.
