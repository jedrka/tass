Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) decreased herbage and root production of a murex medic (Medicago murex Wild.) cultivar by 78-90% and of two burr medic (M. polymorpha L.) cultivars by 56-82%. A mild isolate of bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) decreased herbage and root production of a subterranean clover cultivar by 31-40%, but with a severe isolate the corresponding losses were 60-63010 in the same cultivar and 79-80% in another. The severe BYMV isolate caused losses in herbage and root production of 38-61% in two burr medic cultivars. Seed yield losses recorded due to infection of subterranean clover were 71% with AMV and 58-76% with BYMV (severe isolate); both viruses decreased seed size as well as seed yield.

The swards were then grazed by sheep or mown to simulate grazing. The infected transplants were the primary virus source for subsequent spread by aphids. Spread initially centred on infected transplants resulting in circular expanding infected patches. Later, secondary patches, isolated affected plants and more generalized infection sometimes developed. The extent of spread within swards from the transplants varied with cultivar, BYMV isolate, site and year. Final BYMV incidence ranged from 12% of plants symptom-affected by isolate MI in cv. Junee in 1991 to 100% by isolate SMB in cv. Leura in 1992. BYMV spread mostly occurred in spring and was increased around the edges of areas of bare ground in swards. In two experiments at one site in which 'mini swards' of cvv. Green Range, Karridale and Leura were mown repeatedly, BYMV-infection decreased herbage yields (dry weights) by 12-16% while seed yields were decreased significantly (by 37-40010) in one experiment. In a grazing experiment at a second site with swards of cvv. Esperance and Karridale, BYMV-infection decreased overall yields of herbage by 18-39% and seed by 11-12%; herbage yield losses within symptom-affected patches were 28-49%. In a further grazing experiment at this site with swards of cvv. Junee and Karridale, BYMV-induced losses determined from symptom-affected patches were 21-29% for herbage and 15-25% for seed. In a grazing experiment with swards of cvv. Denmark and ~ e u r a ' at a third site, BYMV-induced overall herbage yield decreases of 8-12% were still recorded despite extensive BYMV spread to control swards; yield losses within symptom-affected patches were 18-25% for herbage and 35-47% for seed. Seed yield losses were due to decreased seed size (mean seed weight), fewer seeds being produced, or both. Estimates of the effects of different levels of BYMV infection on herbage yields in partially infected grazed swards were obtained for cvv. Denmark, Karridale and Leura by plotting individual quadrat data for herbage dry weights against % symptom-affected plants. Losses increased in proportion to the level of infection, but their magnitude also varied with cultivar and experiment. It is concluded that BYMV infection of subterranean clover pastures is cause for concern, not only as regards herbage yield losses but also as regards depletion of the seed bank, which, when compounded year by year, results in pasture deterioration. Early and prolonged aphid activity, reseeding the pasture with susceptible cultivars, heavy grazing and extended growing seasons are all likely to magnify BYMV-induced losses.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1071/ar9941427", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2005, 11, 28]], "date-time": "2005-11-28T07:07:48Z", "timestamp": 1133161668000}, "page": "1427", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 12, "title": ["Infection of subterranean clover swards with bean yellow mosaic potyvirus: losses in herbage and seed yields and patterns of virus spread"], "prefix": "10.1071", "volume": "45", "author": [{"given": "RAC", "family": "Jones", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}], "member": "67", "container-title": ["Australian Journal of Agricultural Research"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "http://www.publish.csiro.au/AR/pdf/AR9941427", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 11, 21]], "date-time": "2018-11-21T04:50:53Z", "timestamp": 1542775853000}, "score": 17.204205, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1994]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[1994]]}, "issue": "7"}, "alternative-id": ["AR9941427"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/ar9941427", "ISSN": ["0004-9409"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0004-9409", "type": "print"}], "subject": ["General Agricultural and Biological Sciences"]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2019, 1, 10]], "date-time": "2019-01-10T22:11:00Z", "timestamp": 1547158260688}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "University Library System, University of Pittsburgh", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["ahea"], "abstract": "<jats:p>More than any other politician in current Hungarian politics, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n refers to \u201ceast\u201d and \u201cwest\u201d in his public addresses as symbols of antithetical political cultures and cultural value systems.

Ten of these were new records. Because seed of herbaceous plant hosts provides a possible route for virus persistence through dry summer conditions, AMV seed transmission was tested for in alternative hosts. Of ten species systemically infected by sap inoculation with AMV, seed transmission was detected in Melilotus indica (l0%), Ornithopus compressus (0 1%) and Stachys arvensis (2%). Seed of seven naturally infected potential alternative host species was tested, and seed transmission found in Crassula decumbens (0. 1%), M. indica (3%), 0. compressus (0.2%), S. arvensis (0.4%) and Trifolium subterraneum (2%). Carry-over of AMV through seed transmission was detected in seedlings of Hypochaeris glabra (0.2%) and M. indica (0.6-0.8%) that germinated naturally in the field. In grazed, self-regenerated Medicago murex and M. polymorpha swards sown in 1987, the virus persisted for at least seven growing seasons. Levels of infection in M. polymorpha seed produced each year declined, but levels in the general seed bank remained higher due to presence of older seed. It is concluded that under the conditions of broadacre agriculture in the Mediterranean-type climate of Western Australia, seed transmission in C. decumbens, H. glabra and volunteer 0. compressus is an alternative means by which AMV can persist over summer to act as sources of AMV for spread within annual medic pastures. However, persistence through seed of the annual medic cultivars sown and of naturalized annual Medicago species is the principal means of persistence. AMV persists readily from year to year following sowing of infected seed and is likely to cause a recurrent disease problem in annual medic pastures.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1071/ar9941413", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2005, 11, 28]], "date-time": "2005-11-28T07:07:48Z", "timestamp": 1133161668000}, "page": "1413", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 12, "title": ["Infection of alternative hosts associated with annual medics (Medicago spp.) by alfalfa mosaic virus and its persistence between growing seasons"], "prefix": "10.1071", "volume": "45", "author": [{"given": "SJ", "family": "McKirdy", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "RAC", "family": "Jones", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "67", "container-title": ["Australian Journal of Agricultural Research"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "http://www.publish.csiro.au/AR/pdf/AR9941413", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 11, 21]], "date-time": "2018-11-21T04:50:54Z", "timestamp": 1542775854000}, "score": 15.699995, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1994]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[1994]]}, "issue": "7"}, "alternative-id": ["AR9941413"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/ar9941413", "ISSN": ["0004-9409"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0004-9409", "type": "print"}], "subject": ["General Agricultural and Biological Sciences"]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2018, 11, 21]], "date-time": "2018-11-21T05:10:50Z", "timestamp": 1542777050430}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "CSIRO Publishing", "issue": "4", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Aust.

The numbers of clover plants developing BYMV symptoms in each row were counted at different times.

However, when young plants of cultivars in categories D or E were aphid-inoculated with 2 BYMV isolates, they became infected to a similar extent to young plants of 2 late-maturing cultivars from category A. This suggests that, except for cv. Rosedale, the extent of BYMV infection obtained in the field was determined by plant physiological age, plants of late-maturing genotypes being easier for viruliferous aphids to infect with BYMV than plants of early-maturing genotypes of the same age but physiologically older, a phenomenon known as 'mature plant resistance'. When plants of cv. Rosedale were aphid-inoculated with 7 different isolates of BYMV, a systemic hypersensitive reaction developed with 5 isolates but not with two others. This suggests that cv. Rosedale has 'strain specific hypersensitive resistance' to BYMV. No systemic hypersensitive reaction developed when the same 7 BYMV isolates were aphid-inoculated to cv. Dwalganup and named selections Pink Flowered and Northam Early, genotypes previously reported to react hypersensitively to potyvirus infection. The field screening procedure employed is suitable for use by T. subterraneum breeding programs seeking to develop new cultivars with resistance to BYMV. Cultivar Rosedale may prove a suitable source of resistance to use as a parent in crossing programs aimed at producing cultivars with natural BYMV resistance.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1071/ar9960605", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2004, 11, 17]], "date-time": "2004-11-17T04:59:24Z", "timestamp": 1100667564000}, "page": "605", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 14, "title": ["Natural resistance to bean yellow mosaic potyvirus in subterranean clover"], "prefix": "10.1071", "volume": "47", "author": [{"given": "DG", "family": "Ferris", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "RAC", "family": "Jones", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "67", "container-title": ["Australian Journal of Agricultural Research"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "http://www.publish.csiro.au/AR/pdf/AR9960605", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 11, 21]], "date-time": "2018-11-21T04:51:37Z", "timestamp": 1542775897000}, "score": 15.699995, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1996]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[1996]]}, "issue": "4"}, "alternative-id": ["AR9960605"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/ar9960605", "ISSN": ["0004-9409"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0004-9409", "type": "print"}], "subject": ["General Agricultural and Biological Sciences"]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2018, 11, 21]], "date-time": "2018-11-21T05:10:51Z", "timestamp": 1542777051037}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "CSIRO Publishing", "issue": "4", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Aust.

In contrast, when 21 irrigated T. repens (white clover) pastures from one district (Bunbury) were sampled and tested in January (summer) 1994, AMV was detected in 16, with eight having infection levels &gt;86%, while SCRLV was found in seven at infection levels of &lt;12%. When a further five T. repens pastures were tested for AMV in October (spring) 1994, the virus was found in all with incidences up to 100%. None of the T. repens pastures with high levels of AMV infection had been resown with T. repens within the last 20 years, whereas those resown within the last five years had little or no infection. AMV was detected in 9/91 annual medic (Medicago spp.) pastures from seven wheatbelt districts sampled in spring 1991 or 1993; a single pasture of M. polymorpha (burr medic) cv. Serena was 21% infected, but the other eight infected ones had &lt;3%. AMV seed transmission was detected in 1/19 commercial seed stocks of M. polymorpha harvested in 1991-93. AMV infection was followed over a 12-year period in M. murex (murex medic) cv. Zodiac seed stocks. It persisted readily through successive seed harvests during this period. It is concluded that infection with AMV and SCRLV is currently not a threat to T. subterraneum pastures in the south-west of Western Australia and that AMV seems not to be one in wheatbelt annual medic pastures provided these are sown with healthy medic seed. In contrast, AMV poses a potential threat to the productivity of irrigated T. repens pastures. SCRLV is also sometimes present in T. repens pastures, but was not found at serious levels. </jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1071/ar9950763", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2004, 11, 17]], "date-time": "2004-11-17T05:02:43Z", "timestamp": 1100667763000}, "page": "763", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 13, "title": ["Occurrence of alfalfa mosaic and subterranean clover red leaf viruses in legume pastures in Western Australia"], "prefix": "10.1071", "volume": "46", "author": [{"given": "SJ", "family": "McKirdy", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "RAC", "family": "Jones", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "67", "container-title": ["Australian Journal of Agricultural Research"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "http://www.publish.csiro.au/AR/pdf/AR9950763", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 11, 21]], "date-time": "2018-11-21T04:51:16Z", "timestamp": 1542775876000}, "score": 15.699995, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1995]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[1995]]}, "issue": "4"}, "alternative-id": ["AR9950763"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/ar9950763", "ISSN": ["0004-9409"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0004-9409", "type": "print"}], "subject": ["General Agricultural and Biological Sciences"]}, {"indexed": {"date-parts": [[2018, 11, 21]], "date-time": "2018-11-21T05:10:51Z", "timestamp": 1542777051051}, "reference-count": 0, "publisher": "CSIRO Publishing", "issue": "4", "content-domain": {"domain": [], "crossmark-restriction": false}, "short-container-title": ["Aust.

Initial spread was mainly to plants adjacent to infected transplants and occurred during grazing and trampling by sheep. New sites of infection subsequently formed away from the original infection sites. Spread occurred mainly in spring and its extent varied with cultivar, site and year. Final SCMoV incidence in swards ranged from 17% of plants infected by isolate MJ in cv. Karridale in 1993 to 60% by isolate P23 in cv. Dinninup in 1991. With cvv. Dinninup and Junee, in two experiments SCMoV-infection decreased yields within patches with symptoms by 11-26% (herbage) and 5-31% (seed); in one of these experiments infection decreased overall yields of herbage by 9-10% and seed by 10-31%. In an experiment with cvv. Dalkeith and Woogenellup, SCMoV-induced overall herbage yield decreases of 10-13% were recorded despite extensive virus spread to control swards; yield losseswithin affected patches were 20-28% for herbage and 19% for seed. In an experiment with cw. Karridale and Woogenellup, SCMoV-induced yield losses within patches with symptoms were 38-44% for herbage and 15-41% for seed. Decreased seed size (mean seed weight) and fewer seeds both contributed to the diminished seed yields. Estimates of the effects of different levels of SCMoV infection on herbage yields were obtained for cv. Woogenellup by plotting dry weight data from (i) individual quadrats against percent plants with symptoms within them and (ii) whole plots against percent plot infection determined by ELISA. Losses increased in proportion to the level of infection. SCMoV infection of subterranean clover pastures not only decreases the feed available but also the seed bank which, when compounded over several years, leads to pasture deterioration. Heavy grazing, reseeding the pasture with susceptible cultivars and extended growing seasons are all likely to magnify SCMoV-induced losses.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1071/ar9950775", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2004, 11, 17]], "date-time": "2004-11-17T05:02:43Z", "timestamp": 1100667763000}, "page": "775", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 11, "title": ["Losses in herbage and seed yields caused by subterranean clover mottle sobemovirus in grazed subterranean clover swards"], "prefix": "10.1071", "volume": "46", "author": [{"given": "DG", "family": "Ferris", "sequence": "first", "affiliation": []}, {"given": "RAC", "family": "Jones", "sequence": "additional", "affiliation": []}], "member": "67", "container-title": ["Australian Journal of Agricultural Research"], "language": "en", "link": [{"URL": "http://www.publish.csiro.au/AR/pdf/AR9950775", "content-type": "unspecified", "content-version": "vor", "intended-application": "similarity-checking"}], "deposited": {"date-parts": [[2018, 11, 21]], "date-time": "2018-11-21T04:51:17Z", "timestamp": 1542775877000}, "score": 15.699995, "issued": {"date-parts": [[1995]]}, "references-count": 0, "journal-issue": {"published-print": {"date-parts": [[1995]]}, "issue": "4"}, "alternative-id": ["AR9950775"], "URL": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1071/ar9950775", "ISSN": ["0004-9409"], "issn-type": [{"value": "0004-9409", "type": "print"}], "subject": ["General Agricultural and Biological Sciences"]}], "items-per-page": 25, "query": {"start-index": 0, "search-terms": null}}, "custom_name_alias": "RAC JOZEF"}
