This is due to rational utilisation of the strength properties of the two materials. At the same time, the reinforced concrete (or prestressed) deck slab is more favourable than the orthotropic steel plate used in steel bridges (higher mass, better vibration damping, longer life).</jats:p>\n<jats:p>The most commonly found in practice are composite girder bridges, particularly in highway bridges of small and medium spans, but the spans may reach over 200 m. In larger spans steel truss girders are applied. Bridge composite structures are also employed in cable-stayed bridge decks of the main girder spans of the order of 600, 800 m. The aim of the article is to present the cionstruction process and strength analysis problems concerning of this type of structures. Much attention is paid to the design and calculation of the shear connectors characteristic for the discussed objects. The authors focused mainly on the issues of single composite structures. The effect of assembly states on the stresses and strains in composite members are highlighted. A separate part of problems is devoted to the influence of rheological factors, i.e. concrete shrinkage and creep, as well as thermal factors on the stresses and strains and redistribution of internal forces.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1515/ceer-2014-0035", "type": "journal-article", "created": {"date-parts": [[2015, 5, 5]], "date-time": "2015-05-05T15:33:44Z", "timestamp": 1430840024000}, "page": "57-85", "source": "Crossref", "is-referenced-by-count": 0, "title": ["Application of Composite Structures in Bridge Engineering.

Derrida argues that both Platonism and Christianity arrive at a notion of responsibility through disciplining or \u201crepressing\u201d the orgiastic or demonic. At the same time, every absolute sacrifice, even if it involves suicide, can never be free from an economy of exchange because there is always an internal contradiction, a \u201csecret\u201d involved, a calculation which leads to the expectation of some form of recognition or reward under the \u201cgaze of the other,\u201d who is God. Here Derrida poses the aporia that no gift, not even the gift of death, can entirely free itself from exchange. This is interesting also when one considers that acts of terror which implode capitalism are also, in some ways, themselves a product of capitalism and make use of its modes of exchange to proliferate.

Specifically, the book introduces a theoretically grounded method for parsing policy issues into categories, and shows how policymaking varies in predictable ways based on the specific issue area being addressed. The book examines the ways in which key factors that influence policymaking matter for certain types of policy issues, and it includes an exhaustive look at how elite political polarization shifts across these areas. The book considers how Congress behaves according to the policy issue at hand, and how particular areas\u2014such as war, sovereignty issues, and immigration reform\u2014change legislative performance. Relying on records of all Congressional votes since Reconstruction and analyzing voting patterns across policy areas from the late nineteenth to late twentieth centuries, the book provides a comprehensive historical perspective on lawmaking in order to shed light on current practices.

Although the idea of studying important lawmaking across time is not controversial, constructing an appropriate measure is not a trivial exercise. The chapter constructs a comprehensive lawmaking data set that provides measures of legislative accomplishment at the aggregate level as well as by specific policy issue areas for a 118-year period.
