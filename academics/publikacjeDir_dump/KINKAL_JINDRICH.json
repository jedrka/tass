While full consideration of such other possible enforcement means exceeds the scope of this article, it is argued that their potential presence (the benefit of which is not disputed) should be additional and not come at the expense of monetary sanctions required to achieve retributive equivalence, which is the minimal necessary requirement to achieve enforceability of antitrust rules."}, {"key": "CIT0036", "unstructured": "See, eg H Hovenkamp, The Antitrust Enterprise: Principle and Execution (Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 2005), 59."}, {"key": "CIT0037", "unstructured": "Theoretically, it could be argued that no private enforcement based on compensation is necessary as long as public enforcement has at its disposal a sufficient amount of available punishment to render antitrust law restraints enforceable in both pre- and post-violation stages.

There is no absolutely reliable method of evaluating whether the means at the disposal of public enforcers of EU antitrust law, when assessed in totality, are sufficient to render EU antitrust rules enforceable. So far no such study has been done\u2014to be fair, probably due to the inherent impossibility of carrying out such an assessment with methods of scientifically reasonable accuracy and reliability\u2014with the exception of an external impact study commissioned by the Commission (http://ec.europa.eu/competition/antitrust/actionsdamages/files_white_paper/impact_study.pdf, accessed on 10 June 2009). However, this study, notwithstanding its daunting length of more than 600 pages, stops short of a result that could be deemed reliable and convincing from a scientific method point of view as it relies on a number of assumptions, for example, with respect to the rate of discovery of secret cartels. Therefore, in the absence of convincing proof that public enforcement is sufficient to make EU antitrust rules enforceable in both the pre- and post-violation stages, it may be desirable to insure against its potential insufficiency in either stage by an effective regime of private enforcement built around compensation and injunctive relief."}, {"key": "CIT0038", "unstructured": "The oft-cited 9:1 ratio of private v public enforcement actions in the US is an example of such complementarity.

century. Annexation distended the boundaries of nineteenth-century cities so far as to obscure broad swaths of suburban and rural districts within their limits. The absence of a literature about these \u201csuburbs in the city\u201d is problematic, because it encourages historical researchers to consider newly annexed territory as urban equivalents of older city districts. This article argues that under the generally accepted definition of suburb, the condition of nineteenth-century urban overbounding obstructs a full appreciation of the historical breadth, ubiquity, and composition of working-class residence outside the urban core. Analysis of the socioeconomic characteristics of regions with suburban population densities within the 1880 city limits of Cleveland, Ohio; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Newark, New Jersey; and St. Louis, Missouri, indicate that researchers have underestimated the degree and diversity of blue-collar suburbanization during this period.</jats:p>", "DOI": "10.1017/s0145553200011731", "type":
